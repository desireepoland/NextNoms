# NextNoms
NextNoms is designed to help you keep track of your restaurant recommendations and bucket list items, discover new local eateries, and decide on places to eat. Easily visualize where you've eaten and where to eat next with filtered lists and custom map markers. NextNoms was developed with a mobile-first design approach so you can plan ahead, or use it while on the go. Available at www.nextnoms.com.

#### Problem Statement (MVP):
I love food, and I love trying new places to eat at. I have a running list of all the different restaurants/eateries I want to eventually try, but don't have a great way to organize and keep track of that list. Enter NextNoms! This app will display a personalized map with pins of your restaurant bucket list items all organized nicely in one place. A pin color change will indicate when a restaurant has been tried, and a toggle feature will allow you to view tried, untried, or all.

#### Market Research:
My applications competition would primarily be traditional bucket list apps, using the bookmark feature on yelp, or individually pinning restaurants on google maps. There is currently no place that focuses in on just restaurants. My app will differ through its specialization and add-on features.

#### Future Features & Ideas:
- Options for multiple NextNoms lists for users - separate into categories such as city, meal, etc. or add tag options for this
- Integrate a front-end javascript framework
- Social Aspect - Add friends, share lists, see which friends want to eat at the same places, suggestions for new eateries based on friends' lists
- Ratings - Give personal rating once tried, pull in additional reviews, view friends' ratings of their tried places
- More filter options - Open Now, Cuisine Type, etc.
- Mobile companion app - receive optional alerts if near a place on your list
