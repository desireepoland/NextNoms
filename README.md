# NextNoms
NextNoms is designed to help you keep track of your restaurant recommendations and bucket list items. Easily visualize where you've eaten and where to eat next with custom map markers and filtered lists. NextNoms was developed with a mobile-first design approach. Available at www.nextnoms.com.
- Additional Features:
  - Restaurant Roulette - Selects a random restaurant from your list for you
  - Discover - Returns the 20 restaurants closest to your current location

####Problem Statement:
I love food, and I love trying new places to eat at. I have a running list of all the different restaurants/eateries I want to eventually try, but don't have a great way to organize and keep track of that list. Enter NextNoms! This app will display a personalized map with pins of your restaurant bucket list items all organized nicely in one place. A pin color change will indicate when a restaurant has been tried, and a toggle feature will allow you to view tried, untried, or all.
####Market Research:
My applications competition would primarily be traditional bucket list apps, using the bookmark feature on yelp, or individually pinning restaurants on google maps. There is currently no place that focuses in on just restaurants. My app will differ through its specialization.
####User Personas:
The main target user group would include tech-savvy people primarily in metropolitan areas. Self-proclaimed "foodies". Key characteristics include a love of trying new things(/foods) and a desire to be organized.
